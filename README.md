# Todo's List

## This is my first big project in JavaScript. The goal is to build a Todos app that eventually works on the webpage using a variety of different techniques I've learnt so far.

### To install
```
git clone https://github.com/Ben-893/Todos-App
```
### To Use

- Open the 'todoList.html' file in the browser. 
- Then open up the console, and from there you can access the current list of todos and apply the various methods contained within 'app.js' to manipulate the list.

### Technologies used
- JavaScript 
- HTML
- CSS

### Further improvemnts to follow...
