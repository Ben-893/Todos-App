# Todo's List
This is my first big project in JavaScript. The goal is to build a Todos app that eventually works on the webpage using a variety of different techniques I've learnt so far.

### To install
```
git clone https://github.com/Ben-893/Todos-App
```
### To Use
- Open the 'todoList.html' file in the browser. 
- From the webpage, you can use the buttons and fields to **add** a todo, **change** a todo by index, **delete** a todo, **toggle a todo** as completed, or **toggle all** todos. 

### Technologies used
- JavaScript 
- HTML
- CSS

### Further improvements to follow...
